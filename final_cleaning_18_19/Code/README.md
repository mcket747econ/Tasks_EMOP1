# emop_clean

This repo is aimed to be the one-stop shop for the basic data management for EMOP data. 

If this is your first time using EMOP, the best place for you to start is Master_clean_emop.do.
The master do-file provides an overview of cleaning process, and what outputs (i.e. data sets) are being produced. 

Please note that this process does a basic cleaning. If you want to further manipulate the data, feel free to fork this repo.
